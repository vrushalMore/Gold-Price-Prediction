### Description
Comparative analysis of multiple machine learning and statistical models to determine the best-performing model on the gold price prediction dataset. The evaluation included metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R² Score to measure the accuracy and robustness of the models.

### Algorithms Used
- ARIMA
- SARIMA
- SARIMAX
- Linear Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES)
- Holt’s Linear Trend Model
- Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters)
- Prophet
- XGBoost
- Gradient Boosting
- LightGBM
- CatBoost

### Best Model Used
SARIMAX and SARIMA emerged as the best-performing model with the lowest MSE, RMSE, MAE, and the highest R² Score.
